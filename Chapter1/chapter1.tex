\section{Composition of the Universe}\label{section:CompositionOfTheUniverse}

Over the past one-hundred years there has been a revolution in our understanding of the universe.
From believing that the Milky Way was the extent of the Universe, the age of Universe was infinite, and that the Universe was composed entirely of atomic matter and photons (cite Hoyle 1950 book).
To now having evidence that the Universe at least extends as far as light can travel in the finite age of the universe ($\sim XXX \pm YYY$), and is dominated by mysterious dark energy and dark matter rather than atomic matter.
Our studies of the universe have improved to such a degree that we are now able to quantify the composition of the universe to percent level accuracy. 
We find that atomic matter (which is dominated by baryonic particles, i.e. particles of the atomic nuclei) only accounts for $\sim$5\% of the universe's total matter-energy budget.
The universe appears to largely be composed of dark matter (DM; $\sim$26\%) and dark energy \citep[$\sim$69\%; see][for more accurate values]{Collaboration:2013uv}.
Very little is known about each of these components.
In very basic terms, dark energy appears to be a particle or field that acts to make the universe expand, while DM appears to be a particle that currently has only been observed to interact via the gravitational force (CDM).
This has come be known as the concordance cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM).
This dissertation will focus on our efforts to further our understanding of DM, in particular to ascertain whether DM interacts with itself other than through the gravitational force or if it really is just CDM.

\section{Dark Matter}

\subsection{Historical Review}

``Dunkle (kalte) Materie'' (or ``Dark (cold) Matter'') was first proposed by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 \citep{Zwicky:1933ub}.
Zwicky had measured the velocities of the galaxies in the Coma galaxy cluster, via their spectroscopic redshifts, and found that given the large velocities the galaxies should not be gravitationally bound if galaxies/stars make up the entirety of the cluster mass.
According to his calculations the total cold dark matter (CDM) mass must be about 400 times that of the mass of the visible galaxies. 
As \citet{vandenBergh:1999jf} notes in his review article, had Zwicky used the correct value for the Hubble constant (rather than H$_0$=558\,km\,s$^{-1}$\,Mpc$^{-1}$) he would have found that the CDM mass must be about 50 times that of the mass of the luminous matter, very close to the actual value of $\sim20$ (disregarding the mass of the X-ray emitting intracluster gas that was unbeknownst to astronomers at the time).
Despite Zwicky's pioneering and shocking findings, the idea of DM did not garner much attention until the work of \citet{Rubin:1970gu} on the rotation velocities of stars and gas in spiral galaxies (e.g. the Andromeda galaxy).
This work was very much in the same vein as Zwicky's work on the Coma galaxy cluster. 
Interestingly, Zwicky also introduced another, completely independent, method of measuring the mass of galaxy clusters and coined the term ``gravitational lens effect'' \citep{Zwicky:1937ec}.
Zwicky argued that if his mass estimates of the Coma cluster were correct, then the cluster should be massive enough to distort space-time to such a degree that as light from distant background galaxies travels through the gravitational potential well of the cluster the light will be deflected and the galaxy images will be distorted in a coherent fashion.
Thus by measuring the distortion of galaxies behind a galaxy cluster one could estimate the mass of the galaxy cluster \citep[see Chapter 2 of][for an introduction to weak gravitational lensing]{Courbin:2002wh}.
\citet{Tyson:1990bc} were the first to successfully measure the gravitational lens effect of a galaxy cluster.
They too found that a mass of the luminous matter alone was insufficient to produce the observed effect.

While the aforementioned work, and subsequent work, found that amount of luminous mass galaxies and clusters was not enough to gravitationally bind the stars and galaxies in those structure, there was still a debate about the solution to this problem. 
Two possible solutions dominated the debate: Zwicky was correct and there existed DM particles, or our understanding of the gravitational force needed to be modified \citep[see][for a review]{Sanders:2002cc}.
This debate remained one of the largest unsettled debates in physics and astronomy until \citet{Clowe:2004eq} published their studies of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-558).
The Bullet Cluster was the first discovered \textit{dissociative merger}, see Figure \ref{fig:MergerTimeSeries} for an example of a dissociative merger.
During the merging process the effectively collisionless galaxies  become dissociated from the collisional intracluster gas, which strongly interacts during the merger and becomes pancaked at the point of collision.
In total the cluster gas is about seven times as massive as the gas.
When \citet{Clowe:2004eq} measured where the total cluster mass was with the gravitational lens effect they found that the majority of the mass was located with the galaxies rather than with the gas.
They then inferred that this was only possible if there was a DM particle that was nearly collisionless like the galaxies; modified gravity could not easily explain such an observation.

\subsection{General Properties of Dark Matter}

For a nice review of our current understanding of DM I recommend \citet{Peter:2012tg}, however I will summarize a few relevant points here.
In addition to the abundance of DM (see \S \ref{section:CompositionOfTheUniverse}) there are a few things we know about the properties of DM.
Most notably DM is electromagnetically neutral.
DM does not interact with photons, either through absorption or emission.
Baryons cannot make up a large portion of DM.
This is know from observations of the cosmic microwave background, large-scale structure of the universe, and abundance of light elements created during big-bang nucleosynthesis.
Nor can DM consist solely of light (sub-keV-mass) particles (e.g. neutrinos). 
Light particles move too fast in the early universe to form the initial density concentrations necessary to seed the cosmic structures observed at later times.
DM is completely outside the realm our Standard Model of Particle Physics.
Thus there is no reason to expect that it only interacts via the known forces.
It is entirely possible that DM interacts with itself via some new dark gauge bosons.
Such DM has been termed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM).

\section{Motivation for Studying Self-interacting Dark Matter}



\subsection{Early Motivation}

The earliest motivation for studying SIMD came from the \textit{missing satellites problem} \citep[see][for a thorough review]{Bullock:2010uv}.
\citet{Moore:1999ja} and \citet{Klypin:1999ej} were the first to note that the number of Milky Way satellites predicted by $\Lambda$CDM simulations significantly exceeded the number of observed satellites.
In an attempt to resolve this problem \citet{Spergel:2000cb} revived a SIDM model with a large scattering cross-section but with negligible annihilation or dissipation\footnote{Such a SIDM model was first proposed by \citet{Carlson:1992cp} and \citet{Machacek:1994kj} to suppress small scale power of CDM dominated cosmologies.  \citet{deLaix:1995ey} found that while SIDM suppressed the small scale power spectrum in a desirable way it resulted in inconsistencies with the observed properties of galaxies.  The \citet{deLaix:1995ey} objects are no longer valid as they only applied to CDM dominated cosmologies, not $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies.}. 
They found that if the SIDM scattering cross-section ($\sigma_{\rm SIDM}/m_{\rm DM}$) is between 0.45--450\,cm$^2$\,g$^{-1}$ then the expected number of Milky Way satellites could be brought inline with the number of observed satellites.
More recently the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) have enabled the discovery of a number of new dwarf satellites \citep[see][for a review]{Willman:2010fg}, effectively doubling the number of know satellites.
This in combination with simulations that better quantified the selection function of these surveys has helped to reduce the tension between $\Lambda$CDM and the number of observed satellites.
While the missing satellites problem is not resolved it is not nearly as significant as originally believed.
On a final note, recent simulations \citep{Rocha:2012tr} show that for $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}/m_{\rm DM} \sim 1$\,cm$^2$\,g$^{-1}$ the effects of DM halo evaporation are less than originally estimated by \citet{Spergel:2000cb}'s analytic estimates, especially in the outer radii of parent DM halos where the majority of satellites reside.
%This is in stark contrast to the expectations of warm DM (WDM; $\sim$keV-mass), which was also originally considered as a possible solution of the missing satellites problem. 

\subsection{Early SIDM Constraints}

Following the revival of SIMD by \citet{Spergel:2000cb} a number of researchers began to constrain $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}m_{\rm DM}^{-1}$ through several independent observations, in what \citet{Peter:2012vi} has termed the ``Y2K-era constraints''.
The Y2K-era constraints fall into five categories:
1) Those that compare the central density of simulated SIDM halos with those observed across a range of halo mass-scales from dwarf spheroids to galaxy clusters \citep{Hogan:2000ih, Kochanek:2000iw, Yoshida:2000bd, Yoshida:2000gn, Dave:2001hh, Dalcanton:2001jj, Meneghetti:2001en, Colin:2002ku}.
Some finding that SIDM created central density cores (i.e. flattened density profile) that were too large and others finding that SIDM with large cross-sections actually exacerbates the formation of cusps (i.e. sharply peaked density profile).
2) Those that compare the shape (i.e. spherical or elliptical) of simulated SIDM halos with the shapes of observed DM halos \citep{Yoshida:2000bd, Dave:2001hh, MiraldaEscude:2002ev}.
They found that as the SIDM cross-section is increase DM halos become more spherically symmetric and at a certain point elliptical halos, such as those observed in some galaxy clusters, can no longer be formed.
3)Those that compared the amount of substructure in simulated SIDM halos with the amount observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters \citep{Hogan:2000ih, Yoshida:2000bd, Colin:2002ku}.
As the SIDM cross-section increases subhalos begin to evaporate in their parent DM halo.
4) Those that estimated the formation of super massive black holes (SMBH) as a function of varying SIDM cross-section \citep{Hennawi:2002kv}.
As the SIDM cross-section is increased the initial seeds of SMBH's can form earlier and more efficiently, at some point the expected number and mass of SMBH's exceeds the observed number and mass.
5) Those that compared and contrasted the observed behavior of DM with collisionless galaxies and collisional gas during the merging process of two galaxy clusters \citep{Markevitch:2004dl}.
This method will be the focus of this dissertation and is discussed in great detail in \S\ref{section:DMconstraintWithMergers}.

%By comparing DM halo shapes and the substructure there in \citet{Moore:2000ee} found that simulations with $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}m_{\rm DM}^{-1}\sim 10$\,cm$^2$\,g$^{-1}$ resulted in halos with singular isothermal density profiles which ``is inconsistent with galactic rotation curves''\footnote{\citet{Moore:2000ee} don't actually define the $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}m_{\rm DM}^{-1}$ they use in their model. Since they treat SIDM as a non-radiative gas I have estimated the cross-section by comparing the scattering depth of such a gas with that of SIDM with a given cross-section \citep[see for example][]{Markevitch:2004dl}}.
%Thus \citet{Moore:2000ee} effectively placed a constraint of $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}m_{\rm DM}^{-1}\lesssim 10$\,cm$^2$\,g$^{-1}$.
%
%Repeat similarly for other constraints... (perhaps too much detail though) and I could just summarize the methods that provide the tightest constraints.

\subsection{Merging Galaxy Clusters}\label{Section:MergingClusters}

Think about moving some of the Figure \ref{fig:4ConstraintMethods} caption to the body text to make for a more concise caption.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=6in]{Chapter1/MergerTimeSeries.png}
\caption{A basic time series leading to a dissociative galaxy cluster merger (assuming the Standard Model of Cosmology).
Two galaxy clusters (N \& S), each consisting of overlapping halos of DM and gas as well as sparsely populated galaxies, begin with an initial physical separation ($t_{\rm 1}$).
Due to the mass of each galaxy cluster they experience a gravitational attraction and accelerate towards one another until eventually they collide ($t_{\rm 1}$--$t_{\rm 4}$).
By convention time $t_{\rm 4}$ is defined as the ``collision''.
Because there is so much space between the galaxies, a strong interaction between any two galaxies is extremely unlikely and they can be treated as effectively collisionless particles.
And since the galaxies of each subcluster have built up momentum they will pass through and begin to separate (this time on the opposite side), $t_{\rm 5}$.
The gas however is more evenly distributed, thus an interaction between gas particles of each subcluster is more likely.
This interactions will convert some of the infall kinetic energy into thermal energy (i.e. the gas of each subcluster will experience ram pressure), the net effect being that the gas halo of each subcluster is slowed with respect to the galaxies and much of it becomes dissociated remains centered between the galaxies of the two subclusters ($t_{\rm 6}$ C).
Much like the galaxies the DM behaves in a nearly collisionless manner and appears largely coincident with the galaxies.
At $t_{\rm 6}$ the galaxy cluster merger is classed as \emph{dissociative merger}.

\subsection{Constraining Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Merging Galaxy Clusters}\label{section:DMconstraintWithMergers}

Think about moving some of the Figure \ref{fig:4ConstraintMethods} caption to the body text to make for a more concise caption.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in]{Chapter1/4ConstraintMethods.png}
\caption{The four means of constraining $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$ with merging clusters, originally outlined by \citet{Markevitch:2004dl} and \citet{Randall:2008hs}. 
\emph{Upper Left:} If the DM is significantly offset from the gas then the scattering depth of the dark matter ($\tau_{\rm DM}$) must be less than the scattering depth of the gas ($\tau_{\rm gas}$) and an upper limit can be placed on $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.
\emph{Upper Right:} If DM self-interacts during the merger, then the velocity of each subcluster will be slowed to some degree.
Thus if the observed velocity ($v_{\rm obs}$) is found to be consistent with the free-fall velocity ($v_{\rm free-fall}$) an upper limit can be placed on $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.
If however $v_{\rm obs}$ is significantly less than $v_{\rm free-fall}$, an upper limit could be potentially placed on $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.
\emph{Lower Left:} If DM self-interacts during the merger, then some fraction of the DM particles will scatter and become unbound from each subcluster.
Thus the mass-to-light ratio of each subcluster can be compared with the mass-to-light ratio of similar non-merging clusters, and depending on where the mass-to-light ratio of the merger is the same or less than the non-merging clusters' mass-to-light ratio, then respectively an upper limit or lower limit can be placed on $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.
\emph{Lower Right:} If the DM self-interacts during the merger, then the DM component of each subcluster will experience an additional drag force and will travel at a slower velocity than the respective subcluster galaxies.
Thus depending on whether a significant offset between the galaxies and DM is or is not observed, then respectively a lower limit or upper limit can be placed on $\sigma_{\rm SIDM}$.
